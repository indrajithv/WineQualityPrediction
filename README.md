# Wine Quality Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine based on various features provided in the dataset, utilizing multiple classification algorithms including Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier.

## Overview

Wine quality assessment is essential for winemakers to maintain and improve the quality of their products. This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on several physicochemical properties and sensory data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various attributes such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, and quality. The quality attribute represents the rated quality of the wine, ranging from 0 (very poor) to 10 (excellent).

## Methodology

Multiple classification algorithms are employed to build predictive models:

1. **Random Forest Classifier**: Ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction.

2. **Decision Tree Classifier**: A tree-like structure where an internal node represents a feature, the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome.

3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric method used for classification and regression tasks, where the output is based on the majority vote of its k nearest neighbors.

4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: A supervised learning algorithm that separates data into classes by finding the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes.

5. **Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with the assumption of independence between features.

## Key Steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handling missing values, if any.
   - Scaling or normalizing the features to ensure they have a similar scale.
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Training each classifier on the training dataset.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluating the performance of each classifier using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test dataset.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Making predictions on new/unseen data to classify the quality of wine.

## Implementation

The project is implemented using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy. Each classification algorithm is implemented separately, and their performance is compared to determine the most suitable model for wine quality prediction.

## Conclusion

By utilizing various classification algorithms, this project aims to provide winemakers with accurate predictions of wine quality based on physicochemical properties and sensory data. Such predictions can assist winemakers in making informed decisions to improve the overall quality of their products.

## Future Enhancements

- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of each classifier.
- Ensemble methods such as stacking or boosting to further improve predictive accuracy.
- Exploring additional features or datasets to enhance model robustness and generalization.
